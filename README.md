### Semantic Emoji Finder for LaunchBar

This is a [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar) action that implements the same underlying data as my [python class](https://github.com/astrowonk/emoji_finder) and [web app](http://marcoshuerta.com/dash/emoji_finder/).

Put the `.lbaction` bundle in `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions/` and it should work! 

`Live Feedback` can be enabled via the LB Actions Editor, but if you enable it, the submenu for emoji variants (i.e. different skin tones and genders) won't work. (the > will show but the right arrow won't work). I have disabled Live Feedback as the default.
