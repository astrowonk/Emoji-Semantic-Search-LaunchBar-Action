### Semantic Emoji Finder for LaunchBar

This is a [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar) action that implements the same underlying data as my [python class](https://github.com/astrowonk/emoji_finder) and [web app](http://marcoshuerta.com/dash/emoji_finder/).

Put the `.lbaction` bundle in `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions/` and it should work!
